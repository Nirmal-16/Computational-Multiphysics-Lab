        "description": "The effect of a chord-wise flexible aft-tail of a rigid heaving airfoil on the dynamical transitions of the trailing-wake is studied here. The two-way coupled fluid-solid dynamics is simulated using an in-house Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) platform, comprising of a discrete forcing Immersed Boundary Method based incompressible Navier-Stokes solver weakly coupled with a finite difference method based structural solver. The FSI dynamics is studied in comparison to its corresponding rigid tail configuration. It is obeserved that the flexible tail regularizes the flow-field and supresses the jet-switching phenomenon by reinstating the wake periodicity. The underlying flow-field behaviour, instrumental in suppressing the jet-switching phenomenon, is identified through a detailed investigation of the near-field vortices dictated by the dynamics.",

Two new non-dimensional measures - maximum effective angle-of-attack and a leading-edge amplitude-based Strouhal number are proposed here, which can capture the physical effect of the parametric variations on the wake dynamics. The study also proposes generalised transition boundaries and an order-to-chaos map through a transitional regime in terms of these two newly proposed parameters.",

        "description": "The present study focuses on investigating the bifurcation characteristics of a pitch-plunge aeroelastic system possessing coupled non-smooth nonlinearities, both in structural and aerodynamic fronts. At low airspeeds, the dynamical transitions occur predominantly due to the structural freeplay nonlinearity while the flow remains attached to the surface of the wing. However, beyond a critical value of airspeed, the system response is dominated by high amplitude pitch-dominated limit-cycle oscillations, which can be attributed to stall flutter. It is demonstrated that the freeplay gap plays a key role in combining the effects of structural and aerodynamic nonlinearities. At higher values of the freeplay gap, interesting discontinuity-induced bifurcation scenarios, such as grazing and boundary equilibrium bifurcations arise due to coupled nonlinear interactions, which can significantly impact the safety of the aeroelastic system.",

        "description": "This study focuses on characterizing the bifurcation scenario and the underlying synchrony behaviour in a nonlinear aeroelastic system under deterministic as well as stochastic inflow conditions. Wind tunnel experiments arecarried out for a canonical pitch-plunge aeroelastic system subjected to dynamic stall conditions. We observe intermittent phase synchronization between pitch and plunge modes near the fold point; whereas, synchronization via phase trappingis observed near the Hopf point. Repeating the experiments under stochastic inflow conditions, we observe two different aeroelastic responses; low amplitude noise-induced random oscillations (NIROs) and high amplitude random LCOs (RLCOs) during stall flutter. The present study shows asynchrony between pitch and plunge modesin the NIRO regime. At the onset of RLCOs, asynchrony persists even though the relative phase distribution changes. With the further increase in flow velocity, we observe intermittent phase synchronization in the flutter regime.",

The present FSI framework comprises a low-order phe- nomenological model, wherein the wake effect is modelled using the classical Van der Pol oscillator. The structure is represented as a cylindrical bluff body with degree-of- freedom along the cross-flow direction. The response of the NES-augmented struc- ture exhibits specific relaxation type oscillations, referred to as strongly modulated response (SMR), passively suppressing the high amplitude vortex-induced vibrations (VIV). The underlying mechanism of SMR is studied using an analytical approach based on the Complexification-Averaging (CXA) technique.",

The response dynamics and the associated fatigue damage of the aeroelastic system, possessing different sources of nonlinearities, are systematically investigated under isolated cases of deterministic and stochastic input flows.

In the qualitative transition in the unsteady flowfield, the trailing-edge wake loses its periodicity beyond a critical wind velocity and becomes quasi-periodic (QP) in nature at a regime of comparable solid and fluid added mass (μ = 5). The correlation coefficient of the vorticity field and the reconstructed phase space, frequency spectra, Poincaré sections, and recurrence plots of the aerodynamic loads establish the presence of quasi-periodicity in the flow topology conclusively. The loss of periodicity is shown to lead to variability in the aerodynamic loads at the corresponding flow regimes, implying the potential requirement of feedback control mechanisms for stable operations at these flow regimes.",

The effect of the gap between the cylinder and the flapper on the energy harvested is investigated through wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations. As the flow speed is varied, a transition in the flapper dynamics is observed, which in turn affects the power extracted by the harvester. Numerical investigations reveal that the flapper dynamics is different depending on whether the vortices are shed ahead or behind the flapper. This study concludes that the choice of the gap influences the energy harvesting potential of such harvesters.",

        "description": "This paper focuses on analyzing the dynamics and identifying the route to chaos in the wake of a plunging airfoil. The intermittency route to chaos is conclusively established using techniques from time series analysis, such as phase space reconstruction and recurrence plots. A qualitative analysis of the patterns in the recurrence plots is used to identify the type of intermittency to be Type I. Moreover, the implication of Type I intermittency into the flow dynamics has been studied through various vortex interaction mechanisms and its effect on the thrust generation.",

      "recent-journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics (2022)",
      "recent-description": "The effect of a chord-wise flexible aft-tail of a rigid heaving airfoil on the dynamical transitions of the trailing-wake is studied here. The two-way coupled fluid-solid dynamics is simulated using an in-house Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) platform, comprising of a discrete forcing Immersed Boundary Method based incompressible Navier-Stokes solver weakly coupled with a finite difference method based structural solver. The FSI dynamics is studied in comparison to its corresponding rigid tail configuration. It is obeserved that the flexible tail regularizes the flow-field and supresses the jet-switching phenomenon by reinstating the wake periodicity. The underlying flow-field behaviour, instrumental in suppressing the jet-switching phenomenon, is identified through a detailed investigation of the near-field vortices dictated by the dynamics.",

      "recent-journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics (2022)",
      "recent-description": "The present study focuses on identifying the dynamical transition boundaries and presents an order-to-chaos map for the unsteady flow-field of a flapping foil in the low Reynolds number regime. Two new non-dimensional measures - maximum effective angle-of-attack and a leading-edge amplitude-based Strouhal number are proposed here, which can capture the physical effect of the parametric variations on the wake dynamics. The study also proposes generalised transition boundaries and an order-to-chaos map through a transitional regime in terms of these two newly proposed parameters.",

      "recent-journal": "Nonlinear Dynamics (2022)",
      "recent-description": "The present study focuses on investigating the bifurcation characteristics of a pitch-plunge aeroelastic system possessing coupled non-smooth nonlinearities, both in structural and aerodynamic fronts. At low airspeeds, the dynamical transitions occur predominantly due to the structural freeplay nonlinearity while the flow remains attached to the surface of the wing. However, beyond a critical value of airspeed, the system response is dominated by high amplitude pitch-dominated limit-cycle oscillations, which can be attributed to stall flutter. It is demonstrated that the freeplay gap plays a key role in combining the effects of structural and aerodynamic nonlinearities. At higher values of the freeplay gap, interesting discontinuity-induced bifurcation scenarios, such as grazing and boundary equilibrium bifurcations arise due to coupled nonlinear interactions, which can significantly impact the safety of the aeroelastic system.",
